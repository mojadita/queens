.Nd Queens on a chess board.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl n Ar board_size
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program calculates all the solutions to position a set of N chees queens
without threatening each other.
.Pp
.Nm
prints its output trying to guess the line width and putting as many
solutions as possible in the same row, so no printing is made until all
the solutions in one row have been collected.
The output of each solution is composed of the solution number on top of
the board with all boards positioned horizontally to fit in one screen,
as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset 1em
1:                  2:

.Sh OPTIONS
.Nm
supports the following list of options.
.Bl -tag
.It Fl d
Prints a huge amount of debug info to standard output, consisting en
all the guesses 
.Nm
makes while it is trying to fit new queen positions.
.It Fl n Ar board_size
configures the board size, for a
.Ar board_size
given, it generates solutions for a board of size
.Ar board_siz
x
.Ar board_siz .
.It Fl w Ar line_width
.Nm uses the
.Ar line_width
argument to enforce the line width in the output.
This is useful when the output is to be directed to a file, and the
desired width is not the same as the one determined by the terminal.
The default value is determined by the environment variable
.Cm COLUMNS
if available or fixed to 80 characters per line.
