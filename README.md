## Queens

This repository contains solutions for two academic problems with recursive search solutions:
* The Knight Ride.   A search in a chess board for a ride of the Chess Knight to visit all the
  board squares, visiting them only once.
* The Queens.  A search in a chess board for a Queens disposition in which no two queens threaten
  to each another.
